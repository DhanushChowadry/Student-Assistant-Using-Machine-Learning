📚 Project Overview
This project is a Student Assistant application designed to enhance the learning experience using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
It provides:

Personalized course recommendations

Study material suggestions

Time management tools

Real-time academic support

The assistant tailors its suggestions to each student's interests, academic history, and learning patterns, aiming to improve academic outcomes, engagement, and efficiency.

🎯 Key Features
Personalized Recommendations: Courses and materials based on students' profiles.

Adaptive Learning: Content difficulty adjusts dynamically to the student's performance.

Task Automation: Scheduling, reminders, and resource management.

Natural Language Support: Students interact naturally with the assistant using text-based queries.

Ethical AI: Data privacy, bias mitigation, and transparent decision-making are prioritized.

🛠️ Methodology
Data Collection: Gathered educational data like course details, user profiles, and interactions.

Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.

Modeling:

Recommendation engine: Content-based filtering using cosine similarity.

NLP engine: Understanding and responding to student queries.

Integration: Backend APIs (Flask/Django), Frontend UI (React/Angular).

Deployment: Cloud-based scalable hosting using AWS, GCP, or Azure.

⚙️ Technologies Used
Languages: Python, JavaScript

Libraries/Frameworks:

ML: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch

NLP: NLTK, spaCy

Web: Flask/Django (backend), React/Angular (frontend)

Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL

Tools: Docker, GitHub, AWS/GCP/Azure
